#+title: README

Numerics for the FBSDE formulation of an OLG model.

The folder ~src~ contains only functions and structs.
The folder ~analysis~ contains scripts generating plots, tables, solutions etc.


** Organisation TODOs
- [ ] Make a proper Julia project, including ~.toml~ files that defines packages,
  versions etc.

** Notes
For demographic stuff, add some of the references about demand for saving.
I think Fahri and Werning has one.
